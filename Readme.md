# Coding Kata for Rock Paper Scissor

The legacy implementation simulates a game of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors between 2 players

In a nutshell
- `Rock` crushes `Scissors`
- `Scissors` cut `Paper`
- `Paper` covers `Rock`

The game terminates when either of the player wins atleast 3 games
